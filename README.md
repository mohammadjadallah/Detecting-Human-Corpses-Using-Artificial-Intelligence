# Detecting-Human-Corpses-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
This project focuses on detecting dead human bodies (corpses) in images or video footage using artificial intelligence. Leveraging deep learning and computer vision models, the system can identify human remains in various environments, assisting in forensic investigations, disaster response, and search-and-rescue missions.
